**Feature processing**

	[Xnew, model] = ftProc_xxx_tr(X,Y,param) % training
	Xnew = ftProc_xxx_te(model,X) % test
	
**Classification**

	model = classf_xxx_tr(X,Y,param) % training
	[pred,prob] = classf_xxx_te(model,Xtest) % test, return the predicted labels and probabilities (optional)
	
**Regression**

	model = regress_xxx_tr(X,Y,param) % training
	rv = regress_xxx_te(model,Xtest) % test, return the predicted values
	
**Feature selection**

	[ftRank,ftScore] = ftSel_xxx(ft,target,param) % return the feature rank (or subset) and scores (optional)
	
**Representative sample selection (active learning)**

	smpList = smpSel_xxx(X,nSel,param) % return the indices of the selected samples

Please see test.m for sample usages.

Besides, there are three uniform wrappers: ftProc_, classf_, regress_. They accept algorithm name strings as inputs and combine the training and test phase.

<h2><font color="green">Characteristics</font></h2>

* The training (tr) and test (te) phases are split for feature processing, classification and regression to allow more flexible use. For example, one trained model can be applied multiple times.
* The struct "param" is used to pass parameters to algorithms.
* Default parameters are set clearly at the top of the code, along with the explainations.

In brief, I aimed at three main objectives when developing this toolbox:

* Unified and simple interface;
* Convenient to observe and change algorithm parameters, avoiding tedious parameter setting and checking;
* Extensibile. Simple file structures makes it easier to modify the algorithms.

In the toolbox, 20 algorithms are self-implemented, 11 are wrappers or mainly based on Matlab functions, and 9 are wrappers or mainly based on 3rd party toolboxes, which are listed below. They are included in the project, however, you may need to recompile some of them depending on your computer platform.

* SVM and SVR: Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin, libsvm (this toolbox is so famous that you only need to google it)
* RF: Abhishek Jaiantilal, [https://code.google.com/p/randomforest-matlab/]()
* ELM: Qin-Yu Zhu and Guang-Bin Huang, [http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/egbhuang/elm_random_hidden_nodes.html]()
* mRMR: Hanchuan Peng, [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/?term=authorid%3A27911]()
* TED: Kai Yu, Jinbo Bi, and Volker Tresp, [http://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~yu_k/ted/]()

Thanks to the authors and MathWorks Inc.! I know that there is so many important algorithms not contained in the toolbox, so everybody is welcomed to contribute new codes! Also, if you find any bug in the codes, please don't hesitate to let me know!
